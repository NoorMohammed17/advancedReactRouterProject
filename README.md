advanced react router project

We are using different hooks from the react router:

1) useParams
  
2) useLoaderData :
After route actions are called, the data will be revalidated automatically and return the latest result from your loader.
Note that useLoaderData does not initiate a fetch.
It simply reads the result of a fetch React Router manages internally, so you don't need to worry about it refetching when it re-renders for reasons outside of routing.

3) useRouteLouderData
   
4) useNavigate
  
5) useNavigation from the react-router-dom
